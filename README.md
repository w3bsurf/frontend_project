The project has been deployed with GitHub pages at: https://w3bsurf.github.io/frontend_project/

To get this running on your computer you need to download, clone or fork this repository.

I used Visual Code Studio on Windows 10 and Git for Windows. For this project I installed node.js which came with NPM Node Package Manager.
NPM is used to install node-sass and gh-pages. Node-sass compiles your scss into css and gh-pages is used to deploy your website to
GitHub Pages.

With node.js installed you can install node-sass by using the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code and typing "npm install node-sass"
And to deploy the page you need to install gh-pages by typing "npm install gh-pages".

The website can be tested with Visual Studio Code with the extension Live Server as you can open any html file with live server.
